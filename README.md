# MCQ-Quiz
 A Quiz in a Character User Interface (CUI), created using Python 2.7x. The quiz includes 35 questions and four categories of questions (including some optional bonus questions at the end of each category). Each question has four choices, and incorrect answers lead to negative marking. The user (or quiz taker) is also provided an option to skip answering any question that they are uncertain about.
Every Question has four choices, labelled by (a), (b), (c) and (d). The valid answers are either the option names or the complete option typed as-is (case insensitive).
